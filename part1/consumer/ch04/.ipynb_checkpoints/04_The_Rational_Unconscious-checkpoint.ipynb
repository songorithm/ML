    "Recently, one of us read a newspaper article that documented an interesting example of what we may call a “weighting error.” When buying a house, one trade- off people have to make is between the size of the house and the length of the daily commute to work. Most people (note that the example comes from a Dutch newspaper) work in city centers. As city centers are expensive, a preference for a short commute by necessity means one is forced to buy a small house or apart- ment. Large houses are affordable, but only for those who are willing to live in the countryside and to face a long commute. It seems that many people think about this trade-off, and many eventually choose the large house. After all, a third bath- room is very important for when grandma and grandpa come over for Christmas,whereas driving two hours each day is really not that bad. Anecdotal evidence has it that a lot of these people come to regret their choice. A third bathroom is a completely superfluous asset for at least 362 or 363 days each year, whereas a long commute does become a burden after a while. Recent evidence (Stutzer & Frey, 2007) shows that people with longer commuting time report systematically lower subjective well-being."

If asked which experience they would want to repeat, most participants chose the longer period. Participants neglected the duration and pre- ferred the option with more overall pain, but with less pain on average. Additional research (e.g., Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996) showed that people use a “peak- end” rule to assess pleasantness of unpleasantness of an experience.

    "In one well- known experiment, Wilson and colleagues (1993) compared postchoice satisfaction of people who chose from five different art posters. Some participants had been merely asked to choose, whereas others had been asked to deliberate. More specifi- cally, they had been asked to scrutinize the reasons for their preference carefully. The expectations of the experimenters were confirmed a few weeks later when postchoice satisfaction was assessed. People who engaged in thorough conscious thought were less happy with their choice. Wilson and colleagues (1993, p. 332) attributed this to suboptimal weighing: “Introspection ... can change an optimal weighing scheme into a suboptimal one. When people analyze reasons, they might focus on those attributes of the attitude object that seem like plausible causes of the evaluations but were not weighted heavily before.” Conscious thought leads people to put disproportionate weight on attributes that are accessible, plausible, and easy to verbalize (see also Schooler, Ohlsson, & Brooks, 1993), and therefore too little weight on other attributes."

    "Is giving up weighted adding as an ideal unnecessary? We argue that it is. At least for complex choices, unconscious thought does quite well in approaching weighted adding. One can ask the question whether unconscious thought does weighted adding or whether it merely behaves as if it does weighted adding. Chater and colleagues (2003) recently published an insightful paper where the distinction is made between rational calculation and rational description. The requirement of rational calculation for weighted adding presupposes that people would “calculate” weighted adding with the exact knowledge of how such things must be calculated."

Chater and col- leagues (2003, p. 67) use a nice analogy: “The wings of a bird may approximate the results of a calculation of optimal aerodynamic design ... but there is, of course, no presumption that the bird conducts any calculations in designing its wing.” This analogy may apply to unconscious thought and weighted adding. Perhaps uncon- scious thought does not quite do it, but it behaves as if it is doing it."
