    "* Consequently, the role of knowledge accessibility in these judgments has not been directly examined. Nevertheless, several phenomena identified in research in this area provide examples of its influence.\n",
    "     1. If the products described are encountered successively, people may focus their attention on the last alternative, which they have encountered more recently and is presumably more accessible in memory (Principle 2). Thus, they focus their attention on features of this product that the first does not have, and base their preference on the evaluative implications of these features while ignoring features of the first alternative that the second does not possess. Therefore, suppose both alternatives have unique positive features that are similar in favorableness. Then, people are likely to choose the second product they consider, as it has positive features that the first does not possess. In contrast, suppose the alternatives have unique negative features. In this case, people are likely to choose the first product they encountered, as the second has negative features that the first does not (Houston, Sherman, & Baker, 1989).\n",
    "     2. If two choice alternatives have common features and, therefore, are not diagnostic, consumers may ignore them and concentrate their attention on only those features that are unique to each option. Consequently, these latter features, which are processed more extensively, become more accessible in memory than others (Craik & Lockhart, 1972). Therefore, if consumers are later called upon to evaluate each alternative separately, the unique features are likely to be given relatively more weight than the shared features. Thus, for example, consumers who have compared two options that have unique favorable attributes and common unfavorable ones may mentally cancel the unfavorable attributes and consider only the favorable ones in making their choice. As a result, they should later evaluate both products more favorably than they would if the comparative judgment had not been made. Similarly, persons who compare products with common favorable and unique unfavorable features should later evaluate the products more unfavorably than they would otherwise (Houston & Sherman, 1995). This can even occur when persons are not explicitly asked to make these comparisons (Brunner & Wänke, 2006; but see Wang & Wyer, 2002, for contingencies in the occurrence of these effects)."

    "* These findings clearly have implications for the effects of movies and television on both consumption and other behavior. They could also account for the effects of unobtrusively placing brands in the context of television shows to which they are objectively irrelevant. However, it is important to keep in mind that priming concepts in themselves are often not sufficient to activate behavior unless the behavior is appropriate in the situation at hand. Thus, activating concepts of African Americans doesn’t lead people to express hostility unless the situation with which they are confronted is frustrating or in other ways conducive to the behavior. As Colcombe’s research shows, priming the same concepts in other situations can have quite different effects. \n",
    "* Be that as it may, both Colcombe’s and Strahan et al.’s studies both indicate that behavior is determined by both activated knowledge and situational features in combination. In considering the implications of this work for consumer behavior, therefore, it would be a mistake to assume that activating concepts and knowledge will stimulate purchase or consumption behavior in the absence of a stimulus situation in which these behaviors are appropriate."

Thus, for example, obese persons eating behavior is relatively more influenced by the physical attractiveness of the food, and by the time of day (as indicated by a clock on the wall), whereas nonobese individuals’ eating is more influenced by knowledge of the food’s nutritional value, or by how hungry they feel.
